  A Kubeflow Pipeline component to prepare transaction data for CLV model training. 
inputs:
  - name: project_id
    description: 'The project_id for BQ processing'
    type: GCPProjectID
  - name: dataset_id
    description: 'BQ dataset of the output tables.'
    type: String
  - name: transactions_table_fqn
    description: 'The FQN of the input (transactions table.)'

    description: 'The name of the features table'
    type: String
  - name: summaries_table_name
    description: 'The name of the summaries table'
    type: String
  - name: threshold_date
    description: >-
      The transactions before the threshold data are used to compute features.
      Format: DD-MM-YY
    type: String
  - name: predict_end
    description: >-
      The transactions after the predict-end are not used in feature computations.
      The period between threshold-date and predict-end is a forecast interval

  - name: max_monetary
    description: >-
      Customers whose monetary value is higher than max_monetary are treated as outliers 
      and excluded from calculations.
